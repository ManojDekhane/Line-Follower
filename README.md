# 🚗 Line Follower Robot 

An autonomous **Line Following Robot** built using **Arduino Nano, 8-array IR sensor, and motor driver circuits**.  
The robot detects and follows a black line path using sensor-based control logic, adjusting its speed and direction in real time.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The **8 IR sensors** detect the black line against a white surface.
2. Sensor readings are fed to **Arduino Nano**, which processes the path logic.
3. Control signals are sent to the **motor driver**, adjusting motor speeds.
4. Robot follows the path autonomously with optimized speed and turns.
